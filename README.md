# Twin-Analysis
A twin analysis code built on MTEX and Matlab's graph toolbox

## Summary
The objective of this project was to recreate and improve on the descriptions of twin analysis presented in [graph theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40192-018-0106-y) and [hierarchy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03343.x) based twin analysis methodologies using an open source toolset.

## Getting started
To begin, clone the repository to your Matlab folder and make sure MTEX version 5.4 or greater is installed. To make the functions in the repository available on the matlab path, run InstallRepo2Path.m. 

For information on how to use the code read the publication linked above. Examples 1 and 2 are provided using MTEX  Ti and Mg twin datasets which are downloaded with your MTEX installation. The datasets for the remaining examples can be downloaded from the following links:  

For discussion of the setup and analysis of the examples see the github wiki.
