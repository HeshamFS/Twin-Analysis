# Twin-Analysis
Twin analysis code built on MTEX and Matlabs graph toolbox

## Summary
The objective of this project was to recreate and improve on the descriptions of twin analysis presented in [graph theory](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40192-018-0106-y) and [hierarchy](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03343.x) based twin analysis methodologies using an open source toolset.

## Getting started
To begin, clone the repository to your desktop and make sure MTEX version 5.4 or greater is installed. To make the functions in the repository available on the matlab path, run InstallReop2Path.m. 

For information on how to use the code, download one or several of the example datasets to the Data folder and run an example in the Analysis database. For discussion of the setup and analysis of the examples see wiki.
